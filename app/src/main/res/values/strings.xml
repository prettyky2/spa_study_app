Please summarize it as much as you can.\nEveryone dreams of being beautiful, and for most, beauty starts with a perfect face, balanced and blemish-free. But sometimes, imperfections are also considered beautiful. For example, dimples improve a gorgeous smile by making the face look cute and charming, and most cultures regard them as beauty marks. The thing is, dimples are actually imperfections caused by a flaw in a muscle under the cheek. A dimple is formed when the muscle divides into two parts. So perfection isn’t always the most desirable quality when it comes to beauty!</string>

It is unavoidable, yet most people believe becoming angry reflects a poor character. Aristotle, for one, would disagree.

Second, your anger should be controlled. After that, you should be angry in a respectable manner. In other words, you should not let your anger be an excuse for shameful actions. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, you should be angry for a good reason.</string>

This sounds nice, but it might not actually be true, according to recent studies. We likely learn more through success, since success brings rewards. For example, hitting a homerun is a momentous occasion for a baseball player. The batter smashes the ball, and the crowd cheers. The batter’s brain registers this reaction and will try to repeat the same process that led to success. This is why players sometimes hit multiple homeruns in a single game. The brain is already on track to repeat success—it isn’t just luck. Our brains recognize paths to success, even if we don’t.</string>

While this is true in many ways, a recent study in the UK revealed that technology is also negatively impacting our minds. The study found that people today, who have access to cutting-edge technology, have worse memories than people had previously. Some surprising statistics support this conclusion. Around two-thirds of UK residents could not remember the birthdays of their family members. Additionally, only a quarter of the residents could recall their own home phone numbers. Nowadays, it appears that technology is doing our thinking for us. As a result, our minds are getting weaker.</string>
